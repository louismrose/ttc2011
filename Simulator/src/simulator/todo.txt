* Fix State to handle variables with same name in different modes?
* Displaying variables
* Variable view in simulator
* Variables and constants should not be mode-specific
* Sounding the alarm
* Deploy to GAE and test there
* Tracing for stimuli
- Tracing for other actions
- Represent variable changes as environmental changes in trace?
- Anything else needed for Alarm.xmi to work properly


Other functions?
- Stopwatch mode should change the function of each button
- Set alarm time?
- Timer?
- Day of the week?
- Date?

- Other simulation controls: whatever is needed when building the reference implementation
