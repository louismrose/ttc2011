Done:
* Alarm should go off
* Button for changing the display type (e.g. 24 vs 12 hour)


Other functions?
- Stopwatch mode should change the function of each button
- Set alarm time?
- Timer?
- Day of the week?
- Date?

- Other simulation controls: whatever is needed when building the reference implementation
