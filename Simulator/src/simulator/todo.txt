Done:
* Alarm should go off
* Button for changing the display type (e.g. 24 vs 12 hour)

Refactorings:
- Continue to restructure such that the execution of the watch is separate from the data model (to avoid polluting the EMF model with operations)
-- Configuration should be loaded from built-in XMI on first request (which hits watch.jsp)
-- watch.jsp should be decoupled from Watch, and instead should grab data from SimulationState
-- reinstate tracing

Other functions?
- Stopwatch mode should change the function of each button
- Set alarm time?
- Timer?
- Day of the week?
- Date?

- Other simulation controls: whatever is needed when building the reference implementation
